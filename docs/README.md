# Docs

These pages are published at https://spookidev.com/spooki-love/docs. The site pulls `docs/*.md` from `main` at build time, so a push that touches this folder updates the published docs.

## Writing a page

- Every file needs YAML frontmatter with `title`, a one-sentence `description` and a numeric `order`. The site renders `title` as the page heading, so do not put an H1 in the body.
- File names are the URL slugs: lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, ending in `.md`. This `README.md` is skipped.
- Link between pages with the bare filename, optionally with an anchor: `scenes.md#layers`.
- Link to source files with repo-root paths such as `engine/Scene.lua` or `scripts/release.sh`. The site rewrites them to GitHub.
- Tag code fences with `lua` or `sh`.
